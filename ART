Mark Rothko, an American artist who described himself as an \“abstract painter\“, once said that he was not the kind of person interested in the relationship of form, color or_similars. He didn’t define himself as an abstractionist, but rather as a person interested only in expressing basic human emotions such as doom, tragedy, ecstasy and so on. This was one person’s vision of art, but what do we mean by art today? Why is defining the concept so difficult?
